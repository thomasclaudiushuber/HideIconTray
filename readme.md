# ShowHideIconTray
Hides and shows the icon tray in Windows 11. In the first edition of Windows 11, there seems to be no option for a user to hide the clock.

This program can hide and show the full icon tray in the Windows 11 taskbar.

## How to use it

a) Either compile and use the program on your own or

b) use the already compiled self-contained executable that will just work on your Windows machine:
  1) Download this .zip file from here: https://github.com/thomasclaudiushuber/HideIconTray/releases/download/v1.0/HideIconTray1.0.zip
  2) Extract the files
  3) Run the HideIconTray.exe file and the icon tray will disapear. Run the ShowIconTray.exe to show it again.
